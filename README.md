# Challenge4
## Description

- This application was designed to demonstrate Javascript and uses of various functions, objects, and methods.
- I built this application from scratch and was able to make a functional quiz that has questions and answers and a timer that is incremented and decremented depending on if the correct answer was chosen or not. 
- After that the user can input there intials and submit them and their score to the highscore page.
